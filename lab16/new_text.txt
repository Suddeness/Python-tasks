night sky glowed neon light
city hummed life lone figure
walked empty street reflection flickering
puddle werent lost searching something
unseen cold air bit skin
didnt mind moment surrounded towering
building distant siren felt free
world silent yet full unspoken
story Maybe one day theyâ€™d
find kept walking blending night
