The night sky glowed with neon lights as the city hummed with life.
A lone figure walked through the empty streets, their reflection flickering in puddles.
They werent lost just searching for something unseen. The cold air bit at their skin, but they didnt mind.
In this moment, surrounded by towering buildings and distant sirens, they felt free. The world was silent,
yet full of unspoken stories. Maybe one day, theyâ€™d find their own. But for now, they kept walking, blending
into the night, a shadow among the lights.
